# Multi-Agent Travel Agency

## Description
This project implements a multi-agent system using JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) to simulate a travel agency. It features two types of agents:
- **Supplier Agent**: Provides flight details and negotiates prices.
- **Negotiator Agent**: Interacts with the supplier to obtain the best flight options based on user requirements.

## Features
- **Agent Communication**: Uses ACL (Agent Communication Language) for interaction.
- **Negotiation Protocol**: Implements a negotiation process with constraints on pricing and preferences.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable for additional functionalities or agents.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/multi-agent-travel-agency.git`
2. Follow the setup instructions to run the agents.
